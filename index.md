### Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?

<p>I think this week was what I would have expected.  I've been able to get an understanding on some of the tools that we will be using through the bootcamp and to meet my peers who will be a part of this process as well.</p>

### What are you excited or eager to learn more about?

<p>I'm looking forward to learning more about front end work.  During the pre-work I enjoyed working through some of the assignments that go through the process of building a page where you can actually see things coming together. I'm looking forward to learning more about CSS and styling as well.</p>

### What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog?

<p>Since I graduated college in 2013 I've worked in multiple jobs in different fields.  Unfortunately in that span of time I never really found what I enjoyed or wanted to do. After getting recommended by several close friends about the bootcamp I decided to apply.  I'm excited to go through this process and to learn a valuable skill that I believe will set me up well for my future career.</p>





## Week 2

### What is something you wish you could do but currently do not have the coding skills to accomplish?

I would love to be able to really understand Javascript well.  I know that we are getting ready to start that this week so I'm eager to learn more.  It seems pretty complicated right now with how much it can do but I want to learn a lot about that since it's a really important piece with the interactive functions that it provides. 


### What are you struggling with?

I think right now I'm struggling with the amount of information that's coming at us but I know that we're only just getting started.  It also has been difficult trying to balance my current job with bootcamp work.  It feels pretty overwhelming but I know that it's part of the process.  


### How do you solve a problem? 

I think that so far I've tried to use the rubber duck method that we've been taught.  Verbalizing the problem out loud and thinking through what it is that I want the code to do.  I also try to research the problem and figure out what the solution is for it.  


### What methods do you use to help yourself get unstuck?

If I feel like I'm getting stuck or just spinning my wheels I'll just take a step away from it for a few minutes and not think about it.  After a few minutes I'll come back and see if something clicks.  If not, I'll get online and research the issue and the fix for it or I'll reach out to the help channel in slack. 


## Week 3 

### What are your thoughts about the roles HTML, CSS, and JavaScript play in the process of rendering content and providing a user experience?

It's been really interesting to see each piece of what goes into a page.  The foundational piece being HTML which provides the text and content on the page.  CSS is also important which provides the ability to give styling elements that are attracting to the eye.  JavaScript also being an important layer that incorporates functionality.  


### What are some objects that your blog incorporates?

I don't currently have CSS or JavaScript incorporated in my blog at the moment.  I do plan to continue coming back and making changes as we go along that reflect some different concepts that we are learning as we progress through the camp. 


## Week 4

### What was helpful during Onboarding working remotely?

Working remotely was helpful for me during onboarding because it allowed me to finish working with my previous company.  It was great to be able to have an additional month of having income from my previous job and benefits before heading into the bootcamp for the next few months.  


### What hindered your progress during Onboarding?

I think one of the difficulties of working remotely during onboarding is that the primary method of learning is by reading a lot of documentation.  I'm definitely a visual and auditory learner so it was challenging for me for process all of the information that was coming at me while building the projects that were required.  I'm really looking forward to being able to learn in person this week.

### How did you overcome challenges during Onboarding?

With being so new to the world of software development I had to research things often to be able to solve different coding issues.  I also would take advantage of the help channel in slack if I really got stuck on a particular problem.  I would do my best to figure it out on my own but would have that available if I really needed it.  

### Bootcamp Sprint 1

What is the number one thing that held you back this week? Why?

I think what held me back the most was not asking for help sooner.  It's easy to get overwhelmed when the project is assigned but going forward if I'm stuck on something I'm going to reach out for some direction sooner. 

What is one thing you would like to learn more about regarding JavaScript (JSON, Data Structures), Bootstrap, or Atomic Design?

Javascript 

What is your “Why”?

I don't have a specific thing in mind about Javascript but I want to get more practice with it and grow my knowledge base around what all I can do within the language.
