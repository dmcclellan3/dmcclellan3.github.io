### Bootcamp Blog

## Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?

<p>I think this week was what I would have expected.  I've been able to get an understanding on some of the tools that we will be using through the bootcamp and to meet my peers who will be a part of this process as well.</p>

## What are you excited or eager to learn more about?

<p>I'm looking forward to learning more about front end work.  During the prework I enjoyed working through some of the assignments that go through the process of building a page where you can actually see things coming together. I'm looking forward to learning more about CSS and styling as well.</p>

## What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog?

<p>Since I graduated college in 2013 I've worked in multiple jobs in different fields.  Unfortunately in that span of time I never really found what I enjoyed or wanted to do. After getting recommended by several close friends about the bootcamp I decided to apply.  I'm excited to go through this process and to learn a valuable skill that I believe will set me up well for my future career.</p>
